# Linear-regression-with-cross-validation-
An implementation of linear regression algorithm which uses cross validation from scratch.

System Requirements:
-> Python 3 or above required

Package Installation:
1. numpy:
			From command prompt/terminal-  $ pip install numpy

Steps to run the code:
1. Place the iris.data file in the same directory as the python file (linear_regression.py)
2. To run the program type "$ python linear_regression.py"   in the command prompt/terminal

Output Explanation:
-> Im using a 5 fold cross validation. So for each iteration of the cross validation a unique beta value is generated as the output along 
with the accuracy of that particular beta value. At the end of the output the average beta value and its accuracy will be displayed.
